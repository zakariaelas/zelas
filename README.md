# zelas

A portfolio website built using Gatsby. 

The goal of this project was to build something that would allow me to better describe the projects I have worked on, the challenges I have faced, and the lesson I learned.

Feel free to fork this repo and tweak it to your liking and needs if you don't want to build something from scratch.
